# Scraping, Summarising and Sentiment Analysis - Stock and Crypto News from Moneycontrol Newsfeed
Tired of trying to monitor the stock or crypto markets manually? Here is a project 
to automate this process.

I've used : 
- Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape finance news from the Moneycontrol Newsfeed via Google News
- Deep Learning using a fine-tuned Hugging Face Pegasus Transformers model to automatically summarise the finance news and,
- Finally calculated sentiment related to each asset using a pre-trained Transformers deep learning pipeline.

Best part about this project is that we can implement this project for 
any financial asset like - Crypto, Stocks, Bonds, Gold, etc. Here I,ve
considered two recent Indian IPOs - ZOMATO and NYKAA and downloaded the 
complete analysis into a csv file.

You could plug in virtually any stock or crypto code and have
 this research done for you.
